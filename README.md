## Documentation

See [the online docs](http://oss.dbc.dk/services/open-search-web-service) for information on using the service.

For code documentation, use [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) similar to this:
```bash
cd doc
doxygen opensearch.doxygen
firefox api/html/classOpenSearch.html
```

## Getting Started with Development

This project depends on a project still in subversion. After checkout from gitlab, 
run the script [`script/bootstrap`](script/bootstrap)
to retrieve this svn dependency:
```bash
$ ./script/bootstrap 
INFO: Checking out svn repo 'https://svn.dbc.dk/repos/php/OpenLibrary/class_lib/trunk' into directory './src/OLS_class_lib'
INFO: Svn repo 'https://svn.dbc.dk/repos/php/OpenLibrary/class_lib/trunk' checked out into directory './src/OLS_class_lib'
INFO: Svn info:
Revision: 122504
Last Changed Author: fvs
Last Changed Rev: 122080
Last Changed Date: 2018-10-02 15:59:39 +0200 (tir, 02 okt 2018)
```

As the name suggests, you can also run this script to update the contents. Changes to the external svn project is handled
as ordinary svn changes.

See the [script/README](script/README.md) for additional info about build scripts.

## Building

The project can be run "as is" in a properly configured Apache webserver, or you can build a docker image to test in.

To build the docker image, in the root directory, use `script/build`. Remember to 
check the options, using `--help`.

```bash
script/build --help
```

The build script requires the [build-dockers.py](https://gitlab.dbc.dk/i-scrum/build-tools) script. You can use this directly, 
e.g. like this:

```bash
build-dockers.py --debug --use-cache
```

Alternatively, you can build the docker image yourself, using plain docker, 
like this, in the top directory:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t opensearch-ws-local/opensearch-webservice:master .
``` 

Note, however, that if you build the docker images "manually", that the scripts for starting
servers, etc, expects the docker containers to be tagged with the name of the branch. In
the example above, this was "master". So, if you are not on "master", substitute the branch name -- or
use the [build-dockers.py](https://gitlab.dbc.dk/i-scrum/build-tools) script.

## Running a Server During Development

You can start a server from the docker image, using the scripts

```bash
script/server
```

This uses the compose file in [docker/docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml), which is configured
to use the Datawell called `fbstest`. The output from 
the log files will be shown in your console. 

## Connecting to the Server Using a Browser

To connect to the server, you will have to ask docker for the port for the system, like this:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{(index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "80/tcp") 0).HostPort}}' docker_opensearch-webservice_1
```

The script `client` does this, and tries to start your favorite browser:

```bash
script/client
```
 
If you wish to do it manually, you can do something like this instead:

```bash
firefox localhost:$(docker inspect --format='{{(index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "80/tcp") 0).HostPort}}' docker_opensearch-webservice_1)/5.2
``` 
 
You can then use the example request to test that the server is functioning.

## Test

There is some functionality to check two OpenSearch servers against eachother, where one
is assumed to be started using `script/server`, in the script `script/test`. This is quite useful, 
when checking e.g. a branch against a "golden master":

### Start a Golden Master

Start the master from a temporary directory somewhere, and get the url for the service:

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone git@github.com:DBCDK/OpenSearch-webservice.git
...
$ cd OpenSearch-webservice
$ script/bootstrap
$ script/build --pull
...
    opensearch-webservice => opensearch-ws-local/opensearch-webservice:latest
$ script/server
```

The above assumes that the master branch is golden (functions correctly).

In another window:
```bash
$ cd /tmp/OpenSearch-webservice
$ script/client
...
[client] 15:23:24.290870903 INFO: Starting ws client on http://localhost:32835/5.2/
```

You need to copy/paste the url, inclusive the trailing /.

### Test against a Golden Master

Go back to your branch and build, etc, and start a server:

```bash
...
$ script/server
[server] 15:25:46.194356647 INFO: GIT branch name found in interactive mode, using it for naming docker artifacts, and docker-compose sessions
[server] 15:25:46.196122019 INFO: GIT_BRANCH: SE-2929
[server] 15:25:46.200179706 INFO: Starting redis service, used for caching
Creating network "se-2929_default" with the default driver
Creating se-2929_redis_1 ... done
[server] 15:25:47.991134309 INFO: Starting ws service, based on compose file in /home/mabd/Kode/OpenSearch-webservice/docker
Creating se-2929_opensearch-webservice_1 ... done
...
```

In another window, run the test (from the branch directory):

```bash
$ script/test http://localhost:32835/5.2/ 
[test] 15:28:02.296973529 INFO: GIT branch name found in interactive mode, using it for naming docker artifacts, and docker-compose sessions
[test] 15:28:02.302806127 INFO: GIT_BRANCH: SE-2929
[compare-request-results] 15:28:02.790747 INFO: Comparing 'http://localhost:32835/5.2/' against 'http://localhost:32837/5.2/' with request from '/home/mabd/Kode/OpenSearch-webservice/script/../tests/requests'
...
```

### Test two Different Builds Against Eachother

The file [docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml](docker/docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml)
declares a docker-compose network, that grabs two built versions of the OpenSearch webservice, and 
starts them against the boblebad staging environment. This can be used, together with the 
[compare_results_results](tests/compare_request_results.py) script to check these against eachother.

First, edit the [docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml](docker/docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml)
file to match the images you wish to test against eachother. Make sure to pull the images:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml pull
```

Now, in two different terminals, start the containers, like this:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml up golden
# use different terminal for the next step
docker-compose -f docker-compose-compare-builds-boblebad.yml up tested
```

Then run the compare script like this:

```bash
./tests/compare_request_results.py http://localhost:22222/ http://localhost:33333/ tests/requests/example/
```

*NOTE:* The configuration differs from the boblebad configuration in that AAA is disabled. Also, a number
of the requests actually fail, because the assume repository names from fbstest, etc. To get an overview, use
the `--response` option to track responses.

There is also a similar file for the cisterne environment.

### Additional test options

In the [tests](tests) directory 
there are a number of requst/response pairs that at some time probably worked together.
However, these are heavily dependent on the data, and are probably bit-rot by now.

There is a script called [diff_os](diff_os) that originally could be used to compare 
two OpenSearch servers against eachother. State of this script is unknown.
 
## Alternative Server Start

If you wish to use a different configuration, you can start with one of the two 
environment files in the [docker](docker) directory:

```bash
docker run -ti -p 8080:80 --env-file=docker/boble.env opensearch-ws-local/opensearch-webservice:latest
```

Currently these environment files may not work.

## Installation Without Docker

*Note:* The instructions below are kept for historical/reference reasons. 

The webservice requires the following files from [class_lib](https://github.com/DBCDK/class_lib-webservice)
to be installed in ./OLS_class_lib
 * aaa_class.php
 * cql2tree_class.php
 * curl_class.php
 * format_class.php (only if openFormat functionality is included in ini-file)
 * inifile_class.php
 * ip_class.php
 * jsonconvert_class.php
 * memcache_class.php
 * objconvert_class.php
 * object_class.php
 * oci_class.php
 * open_agency_v2_class.php
 * registry_class.php
 * restconvert_class.php
 * solr_query_class.php
 * timer_class.php
 * verbose_class.php
 * webServiceServer_class.php
 * xmlconvert_class.php

In the php.ini file:
- make sure that always_populate_raw_post_data = On

Copy opensearch.ini_INSTALL to opensearch.ini and edit it to reflect your setup - inifile settings may be set by environment variables.

Copy opensearch.wsdl_INSTALL to opensearch.wsdl 

Create a symbolic link from index.php to server.php or modify your webserver to default to server.php

Consider copying robots.txt_INSTALL to robots.txt.
