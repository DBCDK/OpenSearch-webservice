search_webservice_tester.py is a test generator designed to test the opensearch web service.

It conceptually works the following way:

1. For each file found in the request folder, a matching file is identified
   in the response folder. Files are matched by name, and the request
   and response folders can contain subfolders.

2. For each request/response pair a new unittest is generated.
   The request is sent to the designated server and the returned
   actual response is compared the expected response. If the
   comparison produces a diff, the test fails.

example of usage:

    python search_webservice_tester.py --url http://lakiseks.dbc.dk/opensearch/ requests/ responses/
